title: Community Guidelines
---
What needs to be covered:

* Pitching statement: Who we are, what we're trying to achieve
* Some framing statements about valuing diversity, contributions, what you can expect if you want to participate
* Specifics no-nos for  harassment, privacy and don't be misleading
* Note about creative commons? (I copied the blue bits from growstuff cause well that was way easier
* Is it worth checking rules / guidelines for conferences, events setup;
* how much are we open sourcing - software only or everything

Rabble Rouser is a community of people who want to build a suite of open-source tools for campaigning organisations.  We believe that enabling these organisations can drive greater social justice outcomes in our world and we're passionate about seeing change.  But it's not all about us, it's also about you and we need your to help us make this great - because many brains are smarter than few.

Whatever your interest in contributing, we hope you'll find a niche and wanted to let you know you'll be valued:

We welcome people of any age, gender identity or expression, ethnicity, nationality, religion or absence thereof, political opinion, sexual orientation, marital status, family structure, ability or disability, appearance, subculture, or other identity or self-identification.

We welcome people of all skill and experience levels, and we don't believe in being dismissive or commenting rudely just because you are new or learning.

Use common sense when interpreting and applying these guidelines; there will be occasional exceptions to these rules.  Conversely, those who violate the spirit of a rule may be reprimanded even if no rule has technically been broken - don't be a douche.
