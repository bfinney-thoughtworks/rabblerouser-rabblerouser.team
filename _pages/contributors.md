# Contribute

## First things first – thank you!

**Talking is good:**

It’s probably easier for you to get set up by talking to the team; so if you’re keen, join our community, we hang out on Slack!

**How do I get a slack invite?**

Email us rabblerouserproject@gmail.com to get an invite sent to you.  Join the conversation 🙂
Some interesting channels are:  #community #tech

**Tha GitHub**

You can find our repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/rabblerouser/rabblerouser-core), we also use [Huboard](https://huboard.com/rabblerouser/core), which links directly into GitHub issues.  For this project, we use issues as story cards and they’re displayed in a Trello-style wall in Huboard.  Bugs will also appear as issues on the wall (but with a bug tag).

In GitHub you’ll see a few repositories:

*rabblerouser-core-fork* is not something we’re working on at the moment.  This is a fork from an old project that was specific to one organisation we worked with early on.  So we renamed it to the fork and we’re now actively working on *rabblerouser-core*.

The core fork will likely remain there until we release our MVP and we’re sure all this specific functionality has been integrated in a more generic sense into the Rabble Rouser project.

**Members or Individual contributors?**

If you became a member of the Rabble Rouser organisation, you can pull and push straight to the repo, however we’d prefer you to fork/clone the repo and then submit pull requests back to the Rabble Rouser team with your changes for merging.

**So you want to pick up a story? Go to Huboard.**

As a contributor, you can view the wall, but you must be a member to make changes – include adds, moves, or adding yourself to a card.

Members can create new issues in Hubbard or GitHub and will replicate to the other automagically.

Hubbard allows you to add more info (labels, because Hubbard has access to your account). wait maybe labels are a github thing…

If someone has an issue, what do they do?  Create a bug

**What about environments?**

Look at the Rabble Rouser core [readme](https://github.com/rabblerouser/rabblerouser-core/blob/master/README.md) for instructions on how to set up environments.

Don’t stress about your operating system, our dev environment has its own VM.  You will however need to be familiar with Vagrant (but that’s all in the readme).

## For BAs, UXDs and non-devs

We’re trying to get better at on-boarding and we’d love to keep the conversation moving, so please join us:

* We have a “community” channel is more for general conversation;
* There’s a sorta tech channel;
* We’d love a group of activist organisations to join the conversation about what’s useful, relevant and helpful in a suite of tools – on the “users” channel; and
* There’s more private channels too, feel free to build on things
